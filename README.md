Project Through c
Hi , This is my first project...


Few pointers to avoid any difficulty while running the program.

1.Since "gets" gives an error sometimes , I have used scanf to avoid unnecessary trouble so make sure not to add any spaces while inputting any value.\

2. I have simulated a chat based system of resolving queries : 
(i)   Enter the query through customer interface
(ii)  Resolve it through employee interface.
(iii) Check the solution of the query in customer interface.


Just go the "1_main.c" in "Src" folder and hit run and you'll be set to go :)
